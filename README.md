Artificial Lighting Optimization for Greenhouses using NLP solvers
Growing crops in greenhouses can extend the growing season if conditions such as light,
temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, within the greenhouse remain favorable for the
plants. To achieve a successful harvest in such environments, it is necessary to supplement
natural conditions with artificial means. Modern commercial greenhouses have become
excellent at this, they are often filled with equipment to monitor and control heating, cooling,
lighting, humidity, and a host of other variables. One of the keys to a steady crop yield is to
maintain the optimal level for each of these throughout the greenhouse. Variability in any of
these factors across a growing area can cause undesired variability in the crop yield across that
area. This project will combat that variability in lighting by optimizing the positions of light
fixtures within a greenhouse, to minimize the variance of light intensity across a space
